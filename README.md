#  Intelligent Search and Rescue System

An intelligent system designed to assist search and rescue operations in hard-to-reach environments by automatically detecting people in images or videos and visualizing their locations on a map.  

The system analyzes uploaded media using a neural network, detects humans, extracts GPS coordinates from metadata, marks detected persons on images, and places location markers on an interactive map.  
All detections can be reviewed and managed through the user interface.
